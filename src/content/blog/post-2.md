Django’s **QuerySets** are one of the most powerful features of its ORM. They allow you to interact with your database in a Pythonic way, making queries efficient and readable. However, many developers only use basic queries and miss out on advanced techniques that can **optimize performance and simplify code**.

In this guide, we’ll explore essential and advanced QuerySet methods that every Django developer should know.

## 1. Understanding QuerySets

A **QuerySet** is a collection of database rows that can be filtered, ordered, and modified before being executed. Django **delays execution** of QuerySets until they are actually needed, allowing for efficient query construction.

Example:

```python
from myapp.models import Product

# QuerySet is created but not executed yet
products = Product.objects.all()

# The query is executed when we iterate over it
for product in products:
    print(product.name)
```

## 2. Filtering and Chaining Queries

Django provides an intuitive way to filter data using the filter() and exclude() methods.

```python
# Get all products that cost more than $50
expensive_products = Product.objects.filter(price__gt=50)

# Get all products except those from a specific category
non_electronics = Product.objects.exclude(category="Electronics")
```

You can **chain multiple filters** to refine queries:

```python
# Get all available products that cost more than $50
available_expensive_products = Product.objects.filter(price__gt=50, is_available=True)
```

## 3. Annotating QuerySets (Adding Custom Fields)

You can **add computed fields** to QuerySets dynamically using annotate().

```python
from django.db.models import Count, F

# Count the number of products per category
categories = Product.objects.values("category").annotate(product_count=Count("id"))

for category in categories:
    print(f"{category['category']}: {category['product_count']} products")
```

Using F() expressions, you can **perform calculations within the database**:

```python
# Apply a 10% discount to all products
discounted_products = Product.objects.annotate(discounted_price=F('price') * 0.9)

for product in discounted_products:
    print(f"{product.name}: Original Price: {product.price}, Discounted Price: {product.discounted_price}")
```

## 4. Ordering QuerySets

Sorting results is straightforward with order_by():

```python
# Get products sorted by price (ascending)
cheap_products = Product.objects.order_by("price")

# Get products sorted by price (descending)
expensive_products = Product.objects.order_by("-price")
```

Ordering with Multiple Fields

```python
# Sort by category first, then by price within each category
sorted_products = Product.objects.order_by("category", "-price")
```

## 5. Selecting Specific Fields (only() and values())

Sometimes you don’t need all fields from a model. **To reduce database load**, use only() or values().

```python
# Retrieve only the 'name' and 'price' fields
products = Product.objects.only("name", "price")

# Convert QuerySet to a list of dictionaries
products_data = Product.objects.values("name", "price")
```

## 6. Using select_related() and prefetch_related() for Performance Optimization

Fetching related models efficiently is crucial for performance.

Using **select_related()** (For One-to-One or ForeignKey relationships)

```python
# Get products with their related category in a single SQL query
products = Product.objects.select_related("category").all()
```

Without select_related(), Django would perform an additional query for each product when accessing product.category.

Using **prefetch_related()** (For Many-to-Many or Reverse ForeignKey)

```python
# Get all products and prefetch related reviews
products = Product.objects.prefetch_related("reviews").all()
```

This reduces the number of queries by preloading related objects in one go.

## 7. Efficient Query Counting

If you only need the count, use .count() instead of len(queryset) to avoid unnecessary data retrieval.

```python
# Count total products in the database
total_products = Product.objects.count()
```

## 8. Raw SQL Queries with raw()

In some cases, you may need to write raw SQL for performance optimization.

```python
from django.db import connection

products = Product.objects.raw("SELECT * FROM myapp_product WHERE price > %s", [50])

for product in products:
    print(product.name)
```

Alternatively, you can execute raw queries using connection.cursor():

```python
with connection.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM myapp_product")
    row = cursor.fetchone()
    print(f"Total products: {row[0]}")
```

## 9. Avoiding Common QuerySet Mistakes

- **Forgetting QuerySet Lazy Execution**: Don’t run .all() multiple times; store QuerySets in variables.
- **Using** get() **Instead of** filter().first() **When Needed**: get() raises an error if no result is found.
- **Overusing** values() **When You Need Model Instances**: values() returns dictionaries, not model instances.

# Conclusion

Django’s ORM and QuerySets offer a powerful way to interact with the database efficiently. By mastering these techniques, you can write optimized, readable, and maintainable queries.

## Key Takeaways:

- Use filtering methods like filter(), exclude(), and chaining for precise queries.
- Optimize performance with select_related() and prefetch_related().
- Use annotate() for aggregations and computed fields.
- Limit fields with only() and values() to reduce database load.
- Always use .count() instead of len(queryset) for counting records efficiently.

By applying these techniques, you’ll improve the speed and scalability of your Django applications.
